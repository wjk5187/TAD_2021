What research question do you want to answer?

- Did Donald Trump’s candidacy, and eventual presidency, mark a shift in the Overton window?


What are two possible answers?

- Trump’s candidacy precipitated an observable shift in issues emphasized and rhetoric used in the context of certain issues (immigrations, foreign intervention, trade, etc.) post-2015

- OR Trump’s candidacy did not bring any major shifts in the rhetoric used in our pre-2015 political discourse. 


What are the documents of text data you will analyze?

- Either GOP debate transcripts or a selection of GOP convention speeches over the span of a few election cycles; ideally as far back as 1976 or 1980.  


Give two examples of documents in the corpus that you expect will be high in similarity to each other? Two examples that are *low* in similarity?

- documents from 2016 and 2020 cycles // documents that are relatively close to 2016 cycle

- documents from recent cycles and those from more distant past (ie 2016 vs 1988)
