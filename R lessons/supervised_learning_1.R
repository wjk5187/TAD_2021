#########Practice questions:


####I'd like you to have experience creating documents from scratch

####Find one of the previous in-class practices and replace the existing questions and answers with these questions and your answers

####Be sure to save it as a new file, with a new filename!



# 1. Which president's inaugural address was highest in anxiety?



# 2. How about positive affect?


#3. Look at the graphs you've made --- are there any issues with the analysis you can think of? Think about how dictionaries work.


#4. Apply a simple fix to adjust for the issue you identified in question 3
